# smart-traffic-signal-optimization

In this work, a hybrid optimization framework is presented
based on the global search ability of the Genetic Algorithm
(GA) coupled with local exploitation methods drawn from
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing
(SA). Unlike current techniques that address one traffic parameter at a time to optimize, our approach uses a multi-objective
composite fitness function that combines waiting time, vehicle
speed, and congestion. This allows for a more realistic and
balanced evaluation of traffic signal effectiveness
